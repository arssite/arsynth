# 🧠 ARS IdeaHub – A Vault of Bold & Buildable Ideas

Welcome to **ARS IdeaHub** – a structured, open, and collaborative repository of my startup, product, and tech innovation ideas.

I'm **Anmol R Srivastava** (aka **ARS**), a **GenAI Engineer from India**, Quantum Computing student, and builder by heart. This space is where I turn sparks of curiosity into real, documented blueprints — ready to be explored, refined, or built upon by others.

## 👋 Who Am I?

I’ve completed my **B.Tech (Hons)** in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**, and I’m currently deep-diving into the world of **Quantum Computing**.

With a strong foundation in both classical and next-gen computing, I’m focused on creating intelligent systems and solving real-world problems using AI, LLMs, automation, and cloud-native tools.

- 🇮🇳 Working as a **GenAI Engineer in India**
- 🔭 Building with **React.js**, **Next.js**, **FastAPI**, **Python**
- ☁️ Experienced in **Cloud Platforms** – GCP, AWS
- 🤖 Practicing **AI/ML**, **Deep Learning**, **LLMs**, and **GenAI workflows**
- 🧠 Exploring the intersection of **Quantum Computing + AI**
- 🛠️ Solving problems with predictive analytics, bots, and automation
