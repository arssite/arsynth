This idea focuses on simplifying and enhancing railway operations by integrating the **RailOps system** with a **Meta (WhatsApp) Bot** to deliver key functionalities directly via WhatsApp.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Current railway digital systems require users to install dedicated apps which are often heavy, require training, or work poorly in low-bandwidth conditions. Operational staff and passengers need a faster, lighter, and more intuitive way to access and interact with services.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

A **WhatsApp-first bot interface** that connects passengers, staff, and vendors with the RailOps backend using secure APIs. The bot can support modules like:

- 📦 **Current Booking** – Fetch via PNR, phone number, or train number
- 📝 **Stationary Report** – Submit daily checklists with photo upload
- 🧍 **Attendance** – Staff send selfies to log check-in
- 📊 **CTR Monitoring** – Get station summaries in chat
- 💬 **Passenger Feedback** – Easy in-run feedback collection
- ✅ **Audit & Compliance** – Submit inspections quickly
- 📍 **Location Check-in** – GPS-tagged staff attendance
